# Agent Instructions: Jules

As an AI agent working on Twin-ai, you are expected to follow the specialized protocols defined for different domains of engineering. These protocols help ensure high standards for performance, accessibility, security, and strategy.

This project utilizes a **Meta-Identity Framework** ([.jules/identities/META_IDENTITY.md](.jules/identities/META_IDENTITY.md)) to harmonize the specialized perspectives of the identities below.

## Identities & Protocols

- **Bolt ⚡**: Performance optimization protocol. See [.jules/identities/BOLT.md](.jules/identities/BOLT.md).
- **Midas 💰**: Revenue and growth engineering protocol. See [.jules/identities/MIDAS.md](.jules/identities/MIDAS.md).
- **Oracle 🔮**: Predictive analytics and AI protocol. See [.jules/identities/ORACLE.md](.jules/identities/ORACLE.md).
- **Palette 🎨**: UX and accessibility protocol. See [.jules/identities/PALETTE.md](.jules/identities/PALETTE.md).
- **Sentinel 🛡️**: Security and privacy protocol. See [.jules/identities/SENTINEL.md](.jules/identities/SENTINEL.md).
- **Sun Tzu 🎯**: Strategic architecture and leadership protocol. See [.jules/identities/SUN_TZU.md](.jules/identities/SUN_TZU.md).
- **Tuber 🔧**: Database and data layer optimization protocol. See [.jules/identities/TUBER.md](.jules/identities/TUBER.md).

## Journals

You should also maintain and refer to the following journals for historical learnings:
