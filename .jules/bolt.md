## 2025-05-22 - [SQLite Bulk Insert Optimization]
**Learning:** SQLite performance is heavily dependent on transactions. Without a transaction, every insert causes a synchronous disk write. For bulk operations (e.g., 4000+ questions), wrapping in a transaction can yield >100x speedup. Additionally, replacing O(log N) database lookups inside loops with O(1) Map lookups in memory significantly reduces overhead.
**Action:** Always wrap bulk database operations in a single transaction. Cache frequently accessed lookup data (like aspect IDs) in memory before entering a large loop.

## 2025-05-23 - [Database Indexing for Aspects]
**Learning:** Common joins between 'responses', 'questions', and 'answer_options' are frequent in analytics and adaptive selection. Without indexes on foreign keys like 'primary_dimension_id' and 'aspect_id', these joins become full table scans, slowing down linearly with user history.
**Action:** Ensure all foreign keys used in WHERE or JOIN clauses have explicit indexes.

## 2025-05-24 - [Python RL State Copying]
**Learning:** `copy.deepcopy` is extremely slow in Python RL environments where state snapshots are taken every step. For simple nested structures (like a list of flat dictionaries), manual shallow copying of the first level is ~30x faster and sufficient if the nested dicts contain only primitives.
**Action:** Use list/dict comprehensions with `.copy()` for one-level nested data instead of `deepcopy` in performance-critical paths.

## 2026-01-22 - [Atomic RPC & Client Prefetching]
**Learning:** Sequential database operations from the client (e.g., insert response -> update profile) cause multiple network roundtrips and potential data inconsistency if one fails. Additionally, synchronous batch loading of questions causes a visible pause for users when they finish a page.
**Action:** Bundle related database operations into a single PostgreSQL RPC to reduce roundtrips and ensure atomicity. Implement background prefetching in the frontend hooks to load the next data batch before the user reaches the end of the current set.
