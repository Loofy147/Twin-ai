## 2025-05-22 - [SQLite Bulk Insert Optimization]
**Learning:** SQLite performance is heavily dependent on transactions. Without a transaction, every insert causes a synchronous disk write. For bulk operations (e.g., 4000+ questions), wrapping in a transaction can yield >100x speedup. Additionally, replacing O(log N) database lookups inside loops with O(1) Map lookups in memory significantly reduces overhead.
**Action:** Always wrap bulk database operations in a single transaction. Cache frequently accessed lookup data (like aspect IDs) in memory before entering a large loop.
