# Twin-AI: The Living Digital Twin

Twin-AI is a multi-dimensional, perspective-dependent thought structure that evolves into a faithful digital reflection of its user. It is not just a collection of features; it is a **living twin** harmonized by the **Meta-Identity Framework**.

## 🌐 The Living Vision

Unlike traditional AI assistants, Twin-AI doesn't just process commands—it observes, inquires, and synthesizes. Through the collaboration of specialized engineering personas (Bolt, Midas, Oracle, Palette, Sentinel, Sun-tzu, and Tuber), the twin builds a holistic "Values Overall Logic" that tracks your growth across every life dimension.

## 🎭 Unified Engineering Identities

*   ⚡ **Bolt**: Ultra-fast RL loops and 60fps UI transitions.
*   💰 **Midas**: Quantifies the real-world value of every insight.
*   🔮 **Oracle**: Predicts and shapes the twin's long-term evolution.
*   🎨 **Palette**: Translates abstract data into the beautiful "Value Graphic".
*   🛡️ **Sentinel**: Ensures privacy-first, multi-tenant data isolation.
*   🎯 **Sun-tzu**: Strategic question selection and holistic alignment.
*   🔧 **Tuber**: Solid database bedrock with perfect schema integrity.

## 🚀 Core Pillars

*   **Value Alignment Engine**: Calculates a holistic "Alignment Score" based on breadth, depth, and synergy of your profile.
*   **Synergy Detection**: Identifies cross-dimension correlations (e.g., how your *Work Style* impacts your *Relationships*).
*   **Profile-Isolated RL**: Trains a functional digital twin in a secure simulation, validated by your actual behavior.
*   **Holistic Analytics**: A unified dashboard providing 360-degree visibility into your evolving digital persona.
*   **Privacy-First Architecture**: Hardened multi-tenancy using Row Level Security (RLS) and encrypted local storage.

## 📚 Documentation

Dive into the living thought structure in the `docs/` directory:

*   [**Architecture**](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): The Meta-Identity Framework and system design.
*   [**Algorithms**](./docs/ALGORITHMS.md): Holistic Alignment, O(N) Synergy, and O(1) RL Reward logic.
*   [**Database Schema**](./docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md): Multi-tenant bedrock and Knowledge Graph views.
*   [**RL System**](./docs/RL_SYSTEM.md): Simulation environments and user-driven validation.
*   [**Setup & Development**](./docs/SETUP.md): Bootstrapping the twin on your local machine.

## ⚡ Getting Started

1.  **Clone & Install**:
    ```bash
    cd mobile && pnpm install
    cd ../web && pnpm install
    ```
2.  **Initialize the Bedrock**:
    *   Run the schema setup: `node shared/generateInitialBank.js`.
3.  **Synthesize the Twin**:
    *   Run the value demonstration: `node scripts/demonstrate_values.js`.

## 🔮 The Result
A digital twin that doesn't just know your data, but understands your **logic**. A perspective-dependent, temporally dynamic reflection of your true self.
